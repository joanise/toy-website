## More stuff

and nonsense. But why?

Being under `docs/` rather than `pages/`, this page's URL is [/docs/docs-stuff](/docs/docs-stuff) and it magically appeared in the TOC for docs! Yay!

```jsx title="a code block with a title"
function HelloDoc() {
    return (
        <h1>Hello, Eric!</h1>
    )
}
```
